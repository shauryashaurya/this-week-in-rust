## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week dominated by small mixed changes to perf with improvements slightly outweighing regressions. There were no pure regressions, and many of the mixed perf results were deemed worth it for their potential improvements to runtime performance through further optimization from LLVM.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [ccfcd950..a77f76e2](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=ccfcd950b333fed046275dd8d54fe736ca498aa7&end=a77f76e26302e9a084fb321817675b1dfc1dcd63&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
